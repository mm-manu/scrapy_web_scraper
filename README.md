## Web scraping with [Scrapy](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy)

Implemented a web scraping spider for https://shop.mueller.de<br>
The spider extracts all products from the different product categories and writes them in a CSV file.<br>
The CSV file is used in another project to build a classifier.<br>

### Usage
``pip install scrapy``<br>
``python start.py``
